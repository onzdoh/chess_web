                    <p>The history of chess can be traced back nearly 1500 years to its earliest known predecessor,
                        called chaturanga, in India; its prehistory is the subject of speculation. From India it spread
                        to Persia. Following the Arab invasion and conquest of Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim
                        world and subsequently spread to Europe via Spain (Al Andalus) and Italy (Emirate of Sicily).
                        The game evolved roughly into its current form by about 1500 CE.

                        "Romantic chess" was the predominant playing style from the late 18th century to the 1880s.[1]
                        Chess games of this period emphasized quick, tactical maneuvers rather than long-term strategic
                        planning.[1] The Romantic era of play was followed by the Scientific, Hypermodern, and New
                        Dynamism eras.[1] In the second half of the 19th century, modern chess tournament play began,
                        and the first official World Chess Championship was held in 1886. The 20th century saw great
                        leaps forward in chess theory and the establishment of the World Chess Federation. In 1997, an
                        IBM supercomputer beat Garry Kasparov, the then world chess champion, in the famous Deep Blue
                        versus Garry Kasparov match, ushering the game into an era of computer domination. Since then,
                        computer analysis – which originated in the 1970s with the first programmed chess games on the
                        market – has contributed to much of the development in chess theory and has become an important
                        part of preparation in professional human chess. Later developments in the 21st century made the
                        use of computer analysis far surpassing the ability of any human player accessible to the
                        public. Online chess, which first appeared in the mid-1990s, also became popular in the 21st
                        century.

                        Precursors to chess originated in India.[3] There, its early form in the 7th century CE was
                        known as chaturaṅga (Sanskrit: चतुरङ्ग), which translates to "four divisions (of the military)":
                        infantry, cavalry, elephantry, and chariotry. These forms are represented by the pieces that
                        would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.[4]
                        <img src="images\220px-Radha-Krishna_chess.jpg" style="width:100%">
                        Chess was introduced to Persia from India and became a part of the princely or courtly education
                        of Persian nobility.[5] Around 600 CE in Sassanid Persia, the name for the game became chatrang
                        (Persian: چترنگ), which subsequently evolved to shatranj (Arabic: شطرنج; Persian: شترنج) after
                        the conquest of Persia by the Rashidun Caliphate, due to the lack of native ch and ng sounds in
                        the Arabic language.[6] The rules were developed further during this time; players started
                        calling "Shāh!" (Persian for "King!") when attacking the opponent's king, and "Shāh Māt!"
                        (Persian for "the king is helpless" – see checkmate) when the king was attacked and could not
                        escape from attack. These exclamations persisted in chess as it traveled to other lands.
                        <img src="images\800px-The_Chess_Game.jpg" style="width:100%">
                        The game was taken up by the Muslim world after the early Arab Muslims conquered the Sassanid
                        Empire, with the pieces largely keeping their Persian names. The Moors of North Africa rendered
                        the Persian term "shatranj" as shaṭerej, which gave rise to the Spanish acedrex, axedrez and
                        ajedrez; in Portuguese it became xadrez, and in Greek zatrikion (ζατρίκιον), but in the rest of
                        Europe it was replaced by versions of the Persian shāh ("king"). Thus, the game came to be
                        called lūdus scacc(h)ōrum or scacc(h)ī in Latin, scacchi in Italian, escacs in Catalan, échecs
                        in French (Old French eschecs), schaken in Dutch, Schach in German, szachy in Polish, šahs in
                        Latvian, skak in Danish, sjakk in Norwegian, schack in Swedish, šakki in Finnish, šah in South
                        Slavic languages, sakk in Hungarian and şah in Romanian; there are two theories about why this
                        change happened:
                        <img src="images\Capablanca-Lasker_1925.jpg" style="width:100%">
                        From the exclamation "check" or "checkmate" as it was pronounced in various languages.
                        From the first chessmen known of in Western Europe (except Iberia and Greece) being ornamental
                        chess kings brought in as curios by Muslim traders.

                        The Mongols call the game shatar, and in Ethiopia it is called senterej, both evidently derived
                        from shatranj.

                            style="width:100%">
                        Chess spread directly from the Middle East to Russia, where chess became known as шахматы
                        (shakhmaty, literally "checkmates", a plurale tantum).

                        The game reached Western Europe and Russia by at least three routes, the earliest being in the
                        9th century. By the year 1000 it had spread throughout Europe.[7] Introduced into the Iberian
                        Peninsula by the Moors in the 10th century, it was described in a famous 13th-century Spanish
                        manuscript covering shatranj, backgammon and dice named the Libro de los juegos, which is the
                        earliest European treatise on chess as well as being the oldest document on European tables
                        games.
                        <img src="images\Shams_ud-Din_Tabriz_1502-1504_BNF_Paris.jpg" style="width:100%">
                        Chess spread throughout the world and many variants of the game soon began taking shape.[8]
                        Buddhist pilgrims, Silk Road traders and others carried it to the Far East where it was
                        transformed and assimilated into a game often played on the intersection of the lines of the
                        board rather than within the squares.[9][10] Chaturanga reached Europe through Persia, the
                        Byzantine empire and the expanding Arabian empire.[11] Muslims carried chess to North Africa,
                        Sicily, and Iberia by the 10th century.[12]

                        The game was developed extensively in Europe. By the late 15th century, it had survived a series
                        of prohibitions and Christian Church sanctions to almost take the shape of the modern game.[13]
                        Modern history saw reliable reference works,[14] competitive chess tournaments,[15] and exciting
                        new variants. These factors added to the game's popularity,[15] further bolstered by reliable
                        timing mechanisms (first introduced in 1861), effective rules,[15] and charismatic players.[16]
